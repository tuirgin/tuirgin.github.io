      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Mrs. R—,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember—more years ago than either of us would like to consider—when I was a mixed up kid trying to figure out my next steps after having lost all hope of going to the one and only—and private and expensive—college I had applied to? You encouraged me to apply to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically%5Fblack%5Fcolleges%5Fand%5Funiversities&#34;&gt;HBCUs&lt;/a&gt;, and I ended up enrolling at Florida A&amp;amp;M University. That was an exciting time. I became turned on to the idea of doing something unusual (for a hitherto conservative, and rather insulated middle class white boy). An adventure! I&amp;rsquo;d get to see how other people lived and experienced the world. I&amp;rsquo;d gain perspective and challenge the closed minded people I&amp;rsquo;d grown up with. There are a lot of words to describe me at that time, but let&amp;rsquo;s just stick with &amp;ldquo;Naïve&amp;rdquo; with a capital &amp;ldquo;N.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keats: To My Brothers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I read this occasional poem which John Keats wrote on the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday of his brother, Tom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-title&#34;&gt; To My Brothers &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line&#34;&gt; Small, busy flames play through the fresh laid coals, &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line poem-0&#34;&gt; And their faint cracklings o’er our silence creep &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line poem-0&#34;&gt; Like whispers of the household gods that keep &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line&#34;&gt; A gentle empire o’er fraternal souls. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line&#34;&gt;And while, for rhymes, I search around the poles,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line poem-0&#34;&gt;Your eyes are fix’d, as in poetic sleep,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line poem-0&#34;&gt;Upon the lore so voluble and deep,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line&#34;&gt;That aye at fall of night our care condoles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line&#34;&gt;This is your birth-day Tom, and I rejoice&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line poem-0&#34;&gt;That thus it passes smoothly, quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line&#34;&gt;Many such eves of gently whisp’ring noise&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line poem-0&#34;&gt;May we together pass, and calmly try&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line&#34;&gt;What are this world’s true joys,—ere the great voice,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-line poem-0&#34;&gt;From its fair face, shall bid our spirits fly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;poem-date&#34;&gt; November 18, 1816 &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loneliness</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20180825-loneliness/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the following, &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; is me. &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; is an unnamed friend and confidant. I badly want to edit this for readability—at times it feels like I&amp;rsquo;m riffing on &amp;ldquo;ways&amp;rdquo; and trying to see how many times I can use the word. But I&amp;rsquo;m letting it stand as is, as it captures a moment of thought in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C:&lt;/strong&gt; Some days my loneliness percolates to a point where it feels like a tangible presence, or rather &amp;ldquo;anti-presence&amp;rdquo; would be truer. It&amp;rsquo;s more, rather than less, a thing because I can see it and know that there&amp;rsquo;s not an answer to it. It&amp;rsquo;s not a thing that my wife or my kids, or you, or my few other friends and numerous acquaintances can touch. I&amp;rsquo;m not even reaching out right now for you to say or do anything about it. Just saying it to externalize it so that it isn&amp;rsquo;t just in my head or me talking to myself in a journal. It&amp;rsquo;s just there. And I&amp;rsquo;m just here. Stating it helps detach from it a little.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Memorizing Mandelshtam</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Re-reading Glyn Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On Poetry&lt;/em&gt;, I took special note of this following passage, which appears just before a section break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A memorized poem can be passed to you intact. I think this makes the written poem unique, in terms of our relationship with its materials—by which I mean the black (something there) and the white (nothing there). The Stalin regime could destroy Osip Mandelstam, but not the poems his widow Nadezhda had learned by heart. That&amp;rsquo;s something and nothing showing their true colors.

      <title>Casaubon’s Incredulity and Negative Capability</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20180824-casaubons_incredulity_and_negative_capability/</link>

      <guid>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20180824-casaubons_incredulity_and_negative_capability/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first made note of this passage of Umberto Eco&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Foucault&amp;rsquo;s Pendulum&lt;/em&gt; in 2005. The narrator is Casaubon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that what we become depends on what our fathers teach us at odd moments, when they aren&amp;rsquo;t trying to teach us. We are formed by little scraps of wisdom. When I was ten, I asked my parents to subscribe to a weekly magazine that was publishing comic-strip versions of the great classics of literature. My father, not because he was stingy, but because he was suspicious of comic strips, tried to beg off. &amp;ldquo;The purpose of this magazine,&amp;rdquo; I pontificated, quoting the ad, &amp;ldquo;is to educate the reader in an entertaining way.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The purpose of your magazine,&amp;rdquo; my father replied without looking up from his paper, &amp;ldquo;is the purpose of every magazine: to sell as many copies as it can.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a surprise (forgotten) day of PTO, I learned of John Clare&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;I am Jack Randall now. I was Byron and Shakespeare formerly.&lt;/em&gt; As I read his verse and am confronted with his dismay at the destruction of the wild places he loved&amp;mdash;this was the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; c.&amp;mdash;I am filled with sadness and nostalgia for how far this has gone in 200 years.

      <title>Poetic Urges</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20180815-journal-poetry/</link>

      <guid>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20180815-journal-poetry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m filled with this longing&amp;mdash;again&amp;mdash;to be taken up with writing and reading poetry. It will pass, a momentary urge. But where does this urge come from? To be known? Who knows poets but other poets? And it seems unlikely that I&amp;rsquo;d find publication when I haven&amp;rsquo;t put the time in. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read, I haven&amp;rsquo;t written in years. But that can all change. And let&amp;rsquo;s say I stop chasing an ideal and just start working at it. What might that get me?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This dressing makes for great garlic burgers. A small touch on poached eggs
makes for very creamy, garlicky eggs. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am 5. I have my whole life before me. What will I become? A fireman. A policeman. A construction worker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am 15. I have my whole life before me. What will I become? A lawyer. An architect. An inventor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am 21. I have my whole life before me. What will I become? A writer. An artist. A god.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am 44. I have lived more than half my life. What will I become? Dust. Ashes. A fading memory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&#39;fancy&#39; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think differently at different times about how much time we have before us and what we can become with this time. But who among us can spend, right now, anything more than the present moment?

&lt;p&gt;This week I noticed an interesting question on Quora: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/Do-we-exist&#34;&gt;Do we exist?&lt;/a&gt; When I
followed the link I was expecting to see Descartes, and no doubt if I poked a
little further I&amp;rsquo;d find him. Instead, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/Do-we-exist/answer/Hannah-Yang-4&#34;&gt;what I found&lt;/a&gt; was a lovely illustration
using a handful of geometrically arranged toothpics. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;words-creative-and-limiting&#34;&gt;Words: Creative and Limiting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was discussing with a friend my failed aspirations to
be a writer. I have a complex relationship with words. On the one hand they
are an art form capable of extending, composing, and in some sense creating
the world of our perceptions. On the other hand, they often tend to confine,
reduce, limit, and damn us to live within a tinny parody of our fullest
experience. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>People&amp;rsquo;s stories change lives. Letting people and their various perspectives into your own life can be threatening for this very reason. Hence xenophobia. Hence othering. Hence culture wars. Hence an epidemic of loneliness in our society.
I grew up in an environment where being gay was felt to be one of the most revolting perversions known to man. And for reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve never understood I was repeatedly accused of being gay.</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;sourdough-starter&#34;&gt;Sourdough Starter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I maintain a very small amount of starter between bakes&amp;mdash;no more than
60&amp;ndash;70g&amp;mdash;otherwise I just end up with too much waste or stored old starter.
(You can use the old starter for pancakes, waffles, crackers, and other
things.) However, when building an initial starter, there is benefit to
volume&amp;mdash;greater room for error. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a few years since I last spent time on poetry. For
whatever reason I seem to go through cycles where I read and write none
of it, and then it comes back like some kind of need. So, I&amp;rsquo;m re-reading
Glyn Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On Poetry&lt;/em&gt; and doing some of the exercises this time.
The exercises for the first chapter involve taking a number of blank
pages and pretending certain things about them. What follows are my
just-spit-it-out first draft attempts. Just getting the juices flowing
again. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember my father reading to me. He made the stories into a spectacle
of elaborate, silly voices. That spectacle became ingrained in me, and
goes with me into the daylight spaces of my own adult life. This
childlike play acting, the art of verbal exaggeration and caricature,
has perhaps been my only salvation from an unbearably melancholy
disposition. My father taught me many things, but the unintentional
lessons have been the most cherished. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
