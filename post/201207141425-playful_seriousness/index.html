        <p>I remember my father reading to me. He made the stories into a spectacle
of elaborate, silly voices. That spectacle became ingrained in me, and
goes with me into the daylight spaces of my own adult life. This
childlike play acting, the art of verbal exaggeration and caricature,
has perhaps been my only salvation from an unbearably melancholy
disposition. My father taught me many things, but the unintentional
lessons have been the most cherished. </p>

<p>Being raised in a conservative, independent Baptist family, I inherited a
predilection for earnestness. My parents, themselves, are evidence to the fact
that earnestness need not choke out lightness or joy, but in me it grew like a
cancer, threatening to smother out every other instinct. The explicit lessons on
religion fed this cancer, like dry brush to a flame. Fortunately, however, these
lessons were subverted by my parents&rsquo; other instincts. From my father came
tales of the trouble he and my uncles got themselves into as boys. Rather than
being told with the sobriety of a morality play, my father&rsquo;s exploits were
related with a bristling, nostalgic fondness. The voices my father used when
reading stories came from a similar place&ndash;a certain wildness domesticated and
made harmless for my consumption.</p>

<p>People can be just as earnest in their passions as in their morals. This
earnestness-run-amok threatened to poison every aspect of my life. It is
really a sort of dissolution, a passion for extremes, which can make of
one either a hair-shirted zealot or a besotted hedonist. Perhaps there
is something heroic about the passionate saint. I know I am often awed
by the lives of extreme sanctity, and in my inspiration I find myself
wanting to emulate them, to be extraordinary. Immediately, I turn on
that word, &ldquo;extraordinary,&rdquo; and find myself staring into the burning
eyes of a mad man, hungry, insatiably hungry, for adulation. Stone him.
Beat him to death with irony. Kill him with farcical voices and the
reading of children&rsquo;s books. Act the fool so as to escape immolation by
spontaneous self-righteous combustion. Laugh violently. Violence. Is
that not what passionate extremes really are? Violence exists in the
extremes and what is the alternative? A drab, tasteless morsel of
balance, compromise, and composure? Somehow I think not. The alternative
isn&rsquo;t some mid-point between two extremities&ndash;I imagine it as some other
plane altogether, and that plane is filled with silly voices. It is
filled with childlike stories. But it consists of more than a romance of
childhood, because it is not an escape into naiveté. It is a place of
the most serious sort of play and the most playful sort of seriousness.
It is a place where tears and laughter are mixed together in a cohesive
unity. It is wholesomeness, where the constituent parts are not
unnaturally abstracted and objectified into contradiction.</p>

<p>I was late in coming to value childlikeness. It was in my 20s that I
began re-reading the Narnia books. When I had first come to them as a
child, I found them dry, fusty, and childish. (I had a strong distaste
for stories about children.) As an adult I began to see in them
something of which I had missed out as a child bent on an early
achievement of adult seriousness. Apparently I was finally old enough to
start reading fairy tales again. The best sort of fairy tale maintains a
deep sense of innocence while avoiding excessive sentimentality. As I
was to learn from G.K. Chesterton, the fairy tale admits of monsters,
but it also insists that the monsters can be slain. Innocence without
naiveté&ndash;this, I found, led to a sense of wonder, and wonder is perhaps
the greatest of all senses. Wonder is impossible where the mad man with
the burning eyes is free to rave. He is the enemy of wonder. While
Chesterton dealt in paradox and radical common sense, George MacDonald
dealt in goodness&ndash;sincere, unapologetic goodness. There is a sense of
earnestness to MacDonald, but it is free of heaviness and melancholy.
His goodness delights. His goodness makes me wonder what attraction
could ever have bound me to the mad man. Why would we not wish to be
this good? Constant in MacDonald is the sense of play. Not the kind of
play that is a shirking of responsibility&ndash;nothing dissolute&ndash;it is a
happy playfulness which takes into its view all the meaning of the
world.</p>

<p>If playfulness and seriousness need no longer be opposites, then studies
may be undertaken not just with diligence, but with mirth. One of
Robertson Davies&rsquo; characters said that &ldquo;Rabelais was gloriously learned
because learning amused him.&rdquo; Montaigne, leading into his discussion of
authors in his essay, &ldquo;On Books,&rdquo; wrote, &ldquo;I can do nothing without
gaiety,&rdquo; briefly before offering Boccaccio, Rabelais, and Johannes
Secundus as authors &ldquo;affording plain delight.&rdquo; He went on to discuss the
delights of the Latin poets, and that category of books &ldquo;which mixes a
little more usefulness with the delight,&rdquo; history. Sister Miriam Joseph
comments in her <em>Preface to Shakespeare&rsquo;s Use of the Arts of Language,</em>
that Shakespeare &ldquo;uses puns in the most serious contexts, a fact which
surprises and even offends many modern readers.&rdquo; I take from this quote
two things: that Shakespeare playfully pursued seriousness, and that
modern readers don&rsquo;t know what to make of this. As a society we find
ourselves dividing and separating light from dark, eliminating nuance,
forcing dichotomies upon everything. But what if seriousness can be
playful? What does this change? Everything?</p>
