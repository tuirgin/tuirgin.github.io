      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first made note of this passage of Umberto Eco&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Foucault&amp;rsquo;s Pendulum&lt;/em&gt; in 2005. The narrator is Casaubon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that what we become depends on what our fathers teach us at odd moments, when they aren&amp;rsquo;t trying to teach us. We are formed by little scraps of wisdom. When I was ten, I asked my parents to subscribe to a weekly magazine that was publishing comic-strip versions of the great classics of literature. My father, not because he was stingy, but because he was suspicious of comic strips, tried to beg off. &amp;ldquo;The purpose of this magazine,&amp;rdquo; I pontificated, quoting the ad, &amp;ldquo;is to educate the reader in an entertaining way.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The purpose of your magazine,&amp;rdquo; my father replied without looking up from his paper, &amp;ldquo;is the purpose of every magazine: to sell as many copies as it can.&amp;rdquo;
