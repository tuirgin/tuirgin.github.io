      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Mrs. R—,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember—more years ago than either of us would like to consider—when I was a mixed up kid trying to figure out my next steps after having lost all hope of going to the one and only—and private and expensive—college I had applied to? You encouraged me to apply to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically%5Fblack%5Fcolleges%5Fand%5Funiversities&#34;&gt;HBCUs&lt;/a&gt;, and I ended up enrolling at Florida A&amp;amp;M University. That was an exciting time. I became turned on to the idea of doing something unusual (for a hitherto conservative, and rather insulated middle class white boy). An adventure! I&amp;rsquo;d get to see how other people lived and experienced the world. I&amp;rsquo;d gain perspective and challenge the closed minded people I&amp;rsquo;d grown up with. There are a lot of words to describe me at that time, but let&amp;rsquo;s just stick with &amp;ldquo;Naïve&amp;rdquo; with a capital &amp;ldquo;N.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</description>
