      <description>&lt;p&gt;Re-reading Glyn Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On Poetry&lt;/em&gt;, I took special note of this following passage, which appears just before a section break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A memorized poem can be passed to you intact. I think this makes the written poem unique, in terms of our relationship with its materials—by which I mean the black (something there) and the white (nothing there). The Stalin regime could destroy Osip Mandelstam, but not the poems his widow Nadezhda had learned by heart. That&amp;rsquo;s something and nothing showing their true colors.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a surprise (forgotten) day of PTO, I learned of John Clare&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;I am Jack Randall now. I was Byron and Shakespeare formerly.&lt;/em&gt; As I read his verse and am confronted with his dismay at the destruction of the wild places he loved&amp;mdash;this was the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; c.&amp;mdash;I am filled with sadness and nostalgia for how far this has gone in 200 years.

      <title>Poetic Urges</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20180815-journal-poetry/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m filled with this longing&amp;mdash;again&amp;mdash;to be taken up with writing and reading poetry. It will pass, a momentary urge. But where does this urge come from? To be known? Who knows poets but other poets? And it seems unlikely that I&amp;rsquo;d find publication when I haven&amp;rsquo;t put the time in. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read, I haven&amp;rsquo;t written in years. But that can all change. And let&amp;rsquo;s say I stop chasing an ideal and just start working at it. What might that get me?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exercises from On Poetry</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20150822-on_poetry-exercises/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a few years since I last spent time on poetry. For
whatever reason I seem to go through cycles where I read and write none
of it, and then it comes back like some kind of need. So, I&amp;rsquo;m re-reading
Glyn Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On Poetry&lt;/em&gt; and doing some of the exercises this time.
The exercises for the first chapter involve taking a number of blank
pages and pretending certain things about them. What follows are my
just-spit-it-out first draft attempts. Just getting the juices flowing
again. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>for Anastasia
I was wrong to ever try to teach you;
The things I want for you cannot be learned:
Swallow sun and dance upon the waters—
Swallow moon and skip stars across the sky.
