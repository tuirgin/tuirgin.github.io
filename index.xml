&lt;p&gt;This week I noticed an interesting question on Quora: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/Do-we-exist&#34;&gt;Do we exist?&lt;/a&gt; When I
followed the link I was expecting to see Descartes, and no doubt if I poked a
little further I&amp;rsquo;d find him. Instead, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/Do-we-exist/answer/Hannah-Yang-4&#34;&gt;what I found&lt;/a&gt; was a lovely illustration
using a handful of geometrically arranged toothpics. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Openness of Thought—Doubting Conviction</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20180708-openness_of_thought/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;words-creative-and-limiting&#34;&gt;Words: Creative and Limiting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was discussing with a friend my failed aspirations to
be a writer. I have a complex relationship with words. On the one hand they
are an art form capable of extending, composing, and in some sense creating
the world of our perceptions. On the other hand, they often tend to confine,
reduce, limit, and damn us to live within a tinny parody of our fullest
experience. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>People&#39;s Stories</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20180607-peoples_stories/</link>

      <description>People&amp;rsquo;s stories change lives. Letting people and their various perspectives into your own life can be threatening for this very reason. Hence xenophobia. Hence othering. Hence culture wars. Hence an epidemic of loneliness in our society.
I grew up in an environment where being gay was felt to be one of the most revolting perversions known to man. And for reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve never understood I was repeatedly accused of being gay.</description>

      <title>Chocolate Stout Cake Recipe</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20180526-stout_cake/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This chocolate cake is dense and rich, but not overly sweet, especially if it is
divided into 4 layers. It has been Anastasia&amp;rsquo;s birthday cake since she was
little. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These burgers are a family favorite. Simple, thick slices of everything, and
finished off with a spicy dressing that balances it all out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mash-Based Sourdough Starter</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20161003-bread-mash_starter/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;sourdough-starter&#34;&gt;Sourdough Starter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I maintain a very small amount of starter between bakes&amp;mdash;no more than
60&amp;ndash;70g&amp;mdash;otherwise I just end up with too much waste or stored old starter.
(You can use the old starter for pancakes, waffles, crackers, and other
things.) However, when building an initial starter, there is benefit to
volume&amp;mdash;greater room for error. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exercises from On Poetry</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/20150822-on_poetry-exercises/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a few years since I last spent time on poetry. For
whatever reason I seem to go through cycles where I read and write none
of it, and then it comes back like some kind of need. So, I&amp;rsquo;m re-reading
Glyn Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On Poetry&lt;/em&gt; and doing some of the exercises this time.
The exercises for the first chapter involve taking a number of blank
pages and pretending certain things about them. What follows are my
just-spit-it-out first draft attempts. Just getting the juices flowing
again. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>for Anastasia
I was wrong to ever try to teach you;
The things I want for you cannot be learned:
Swallow sun and dance upon the waters—
Swallow moon and skip stars across the sky.

      <title>On Playful Seriousness</title>
      <link>https://www.tuirgin.com/post/201207141425-playful_seriousness/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember my father reading to me. He made the stories into a spectacle
of elaborate, silly voices. That spectacle became ingrained in me, and
goes with me into the daylight spaces of my own adult life. This
childlike play acting, the art of verbal exaggeration and caricature,
has perhaps been my only salvation from an unbearably melancholy
disposition. My father taught me many things, but the unintentional
lessons have been the most cherished. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018 Update: I wrote these messages 11 years ago and numerous features of my
beliefs have changed since that time. The core message stands. I refuse to
believe that God is worse than me. I refuse to believe that God is a monster.
