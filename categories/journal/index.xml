      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a surprise (forgotten) day of PTO, I learned of John Clare&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;I am Jack Randall now. I was Byron and Shakespeare formerly.&lt;/em&gt; As I read his verse and am confronted with his dismay at the destruction of the wild places he loved&amp;mdash;this was the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; c.&amp;mdash;I am filled with sadness and nostalgia for how far this has gone in 200 years.

      <title>Poetic Urges</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m filled with this longing&amp;mdash;again&amp;mdash;to be taken up with writing and reading poetry. It will pass, a momentary urge. But where does this urge come from? To be known? Who knows poets but other poets? And it seems unlikely that I&amp;rsquo;d find publication when I haven&amp;rsquo;t put the time in. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read, I haven&amp;rsquo;t written in years. But that can all change. And let&amp;rsquo;s say I stop chasing an ideal and just start working at it. What might that get me?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am 5. I have my whole life before me. What will I become? A fireman. A policeman. A construction worker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am 15. I have my whole life before me. What will I become? A lawyer. An architect. An inventor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am 21. I have my whole life before me. What will I become? A writer. An artist. A god.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am 44. I have lived more than half my life. What will I become? Dust. Ashes. A fading memory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&#39;fancy&#39; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think differently at different times about how much time we have before us and what we can become with this time. But who among us can spend, right now, anything more than the present moment?
