      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m filled with this longing&amp;mdash;again&amp;mdash;to be taken up with writing and reading poetry. It will pass, a momentary urge. But where does this urge come from? To be known? Who knows poets but other poets? And it seems unlikely that I&amp;rsquo;d find publication when I haven&amp;rsquo;t put the time in. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read, I haven&amp;rsquo;t written in years. But that can all change. And let&amp;rsquo;s say I stop chasing an ideal and just start working at it. What might that get me?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a few years since I last spent time on poetry. For
whatever reason I seem to go through cycles where I read and write none
of it, and then it comes back like some kind of need. So, I&amp;rsquo;m re-reading
Glyn Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On Poetry&lt;/em&gt; and doing some of the exercises this time.
The exercises for the first chapter involve taking a number of blank
pages and pretending certain things about them. What follows are my
just-spit-it-out first draft attempts. Just getting the juices flowing
again. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>for Anastasia
I was wrong to ever try to teach you;
The things I want for you cannot be learned:
Swallow sun and dance upon the waters—
Swallow moon and skip stars across the sky.

      <title>On Playful Seriousness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember my father reading to me. He made the stories into a spectacle
of elaborate, silly voices. That spectacle became ingrained in me, and
goes with me into the daylight spaces of my own adult life. This
childlike play acting, the art of verbal exaggeration and caricature,
has perhaps been my only salvation from an unbearably melancholy
disposition. My father taught me many things, but the unintentional
lessons have been the most cherished. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
