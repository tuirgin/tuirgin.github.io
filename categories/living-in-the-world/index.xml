&lt;p&gt;This week I noticed an interesting question on Quora: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/Do-we-exist&#34;&gt;Do we exist?&lt;/a&gt; When I
followed the link I was expecting to see Descartes, and no doubt if I poked a
little further I&amp;rsquo;d find him. Instead, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/Do-we-exist/answer/Hannah-Yang-4&#34;&gt;what I found&lt;/a&gt; was a lovely illustration
using a handful of geometrically arranged toothpics. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Openness of Thought—Doubting Conviction</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;words-creative-and-limiting&#34;&gt;Words: Creative and Limiting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was discussing with a friend my failed aspirations to
be a writer. I have a complex relationship with words. On the one hand they
are an art form capable of extending, composing, and in some sense creating
the world of our perceptions. On the other hand, they often tend to confine,
reduce, limit, and damn us to live within a tinny parody of our fullest
experience. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>People&#39;s Stories</title>

      <description>People&amp;rsquo;s stories change lives. Letting people and their various perspectives into your own life can be threatening for this very reason. Hence xenophobia. Hence othering. Hence culture wars. Hence an epidemic of loneliness in our society.
I grew up in an environment where being gay was felt to be one of the most revolting perversions known to man. And for reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve never understood I was repeatedly accused of being gay.</description>

      <title>On Playful Seriousness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember my father reading to me. He made the stories into a spectacle
of elaborate, silly voices. That spectacle became ingrained in me, and
goes with me into the daylight spaces of my own adult life. This
childlike play acting, the art of verbal exaggeration and caricature,
has perhaps been my only salvation from an unbearably melancholy
disposition. My father taught me many things, but the unintentional
lessons have been the most cherished. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018 Update: I wrote these messages 11 years ago and numerous features of my
beliefs have changed since that time. The core message stands. I refuse to
believe that God is worse than me. I refuse to believe that God is a monster.
